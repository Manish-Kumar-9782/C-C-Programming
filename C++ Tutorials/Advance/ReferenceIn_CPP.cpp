In this section we will discus about the references, what is the  referenc
and how to use it.

In C++ there are three types of varaible:

1. An ordinary variable is a variable that contains the value of some type.

2. A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. it
    can be dereferenced to retrieve the value to which this pointer points to.

3. There is another variable that C++ supports, reference. it is a variable
    that behaves as an alias for another variable.

Create a Reference variable:

    Reference can be created by simpley using an ampersand (&) operator.
    when we create a variable, then it occupies some memory location. We can
    create a reference of the variable; therfore, we can access the original
    variable by using either name of the variable or refernece.

Syntax:
    int = a; // integer type variable.
    int &b = a; // a refernece variable which will refer the variable a.

In C++ we have two types of reference:

    1. Reference to non-const values.
    2. Reference an aliases.
